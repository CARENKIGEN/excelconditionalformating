# excelconditionalformating
Conditional Formatting in Excel dynamically applies formatting (colors, icons, bars) to cells based on specified rules. It helps visualize data trends, outliers, and key metrics without manual adjustments.

Key Features
Rule-Based Formatting: Applies styles when conditions (e.g., values > threshold, text matches) are met.

Built-in Rules:

Highlight Cells: Color cells based on comparisons (greater than, less than, between, etc.).

Data Bars: Gradient/filled bars proportional to cell values.

Color Scales: Heatmap-like gradients (low to high values).

Icon Sets: Symbols (arrows, flags) to categorize data.
